          <h4>Objective & Motivation</h4>
          <p>During the development of our Competition RC aircraft, the team relied on a proprietary aerodynamic model to predict flight characteristics. Theoretical models often diverge from real-world physics; therefore, we required an onboard system to capture high-fidelity telemetry.</p>
          <p>The goal was to validate theoretical performance against physical data to refine the airframe for the AIAA national competition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quadrant">
          <h4>Requirements & Constraints</h4>
          <p>The system was initiated with undefined sensor hardware, requiring a flexible design to accommodate various data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spatial Constraints:</strong> Initial size estimate of 120 x 60 mm based on available fuselage volume.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Complexity:</strong> Requirement to aggregate GPS coordinates, Pitot-static airspeed, elevation, and tri-axial acceleration.</li>
            <li><strong>Survivability:</strong> Mechanical housing must protect hardware from vibration during high-G maneuvers and survive a catastrophic crash.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Maintain a live link for real-time wireless transmission to a ground-station PC.</li>

        <h4>Iterative Design Evolution</h4>
        <div class="timeline">
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Iteration 1: Proof of Concept</b>
            <span>Developed a baseline configuration using a standard flight controller and dual-sensor AoA system. This version was deployed on a secondary test aircraft to validate sensor synchronization and code stability without risking the primary competition airframe.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Iteration 2: Multi-Stream Expansion & Survival</b>
            <span>Expanded the system architecture by integrating an Arduino to handle new data streams: throttle input, voltage, and current. This version featured a second SD card storing data from the new sensors and was tested on the initial competition prototype. Following a stall-induced crash, the "Black Box" survived, providing the first set of post-mortem data that proved the value of the ruggedized housing.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Iteration 3: Architectural Pivot (The ESP32 Transition)</b>
            <span>To overcome the memory and processing limitations of the Arduino, we transitioned the system to an ESP32 microcontroller. This allowed for higher-speed logging and the integration of a GPS module and a pitot-static tube for real-time airspeed measurement. This pivot was essential for handling the simultaneous high-speed logging and wireless telemetry offloading required by the final mission profile.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Iteration 4: Mechanical Miniaturization & Accessibility</b>
            <span>Driven by a new, more compact airframe chassis, I redesigned the mechanical housing to drastically reduce its footprint to 40 x 70 mm—a 60% reduction in area. This Iteration introduced a "dual-face" opening lid to improve internal access and implemented quick-connect plugs for external sensors, significantly reducing assembly time and field-service complexity. I utilized 3D vertical stacking in CAD to maximize internal real estate while maintaining structural integrity.</span>

      <div class="results-highlight">
        <h4>Result Highlights</h4>
        <p>On every subsequent test flight, the system successfully captured a comprehensive dataset exhibiting a <strong>0.7 p-value correlation</strong> at its best between physical telemetry and theoretical predictions.</p>
        <p>Analysis of this data pinpointed specific aerodynamic discrepancies, leading to critical adjustments in our proprietary flight model. These refinements directly optimized stability and performance, ultimately securing the team's design proposal a rank of <strong>25 in the global ranking</strong>.</p>

          <h4>Objective & Motivation</h4>
          <p><strong>Current State:</strong> Zero onboard AoA instrumentation, leading to a reliance on theoretical models rather than real-time empirical data.</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Constraint:</strong> Commercial sensors were either too expensive for the team or lacked the specialized specs needed for our flight conditions.</p>
          <p><strong>Design Objective:</strong> Establish a new standard for onboard data collection by achieving ≤1% measurement error through a frictionless sensing architecture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quadrant">
          <h4>Technical Process</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Research & Design:</strong> I started by analyzing different implementations of Angle of Attack designs of commercial and military aircraft. This research informed the decision to use a vane-style sensor to ensure alignment with the relative wind.</li>
            <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Initial prototypes were 3D printed to test the fitment of Hall Effect sensors and magnets. These early versions focused on proof-of-concept of rotation and accuracy rather than aerodynamic efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Final V1.0 Implementation:</strong> Version 1.0 transitioned to an assembly utilizing stainless steel ball bearings with a 3D printed shaft and wing. This reduced mechanical resistance and friction, allowing the vane to react to even the slightest changes in pitch.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="full-width-section">
        <h4>Iterative Design Evolution</h4>
        <div class="timeline">
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Iteration 1: Aerodynamic Optimization (The Wedge Pivot)</b>
            <span>We pivoted from a curved design to a simplified wedge-shaped wing because our calculations showed it had a lower moment, leading to much more accurate data. This geometry provided predictable aerodynamic behavior and was significantly easier to manufacture via 3D printing. Additionally, the flat surfaces made it easier to calculate and locate the initial CoG for the assembly.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Iteration 2: Mass Balancing & The Counter-Boom</b>
            <span>To ensure the sensor was only manipulated by the resultant wind, I added a counter-balancing boom on the opposite side of the pivot. The goal was to move the CoG to the absolute center of rotation. This resulted in a perfectly balanced sensor where gravity or centripetal forces during flight maneuvers wouldn't create "false" readings, ensuring the vane tracks the wind vector with ≤ 1° of error.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Iteration 3: Isolating Relative Wind (Work in Progress)</b>
            <span>In previous designs, sensors were mounted on the wingtips, where wingtip vortices could introduce turbulence and degrade accuracy. To resolve this, we transitioned to a single-sensor configuration mounted on the underside of the wing. By positioning the sensor outside of the wing's boundary layer and the propeller's airwash, we ensured the vane is exposed to "clean" air. We have successfully manufactured and flight-tested the first prototype of this configuration, and refinement of this design is currently a work in progress.</span>

        <p>This project successfully produced the <strong>first dual-AoA sensor configuration in team history</strong>. By utilizing high-precision bearings and balanced geometry, the system achieved a tolerance of <strong>± 0.5°</strong>.</p>
        <p>Data captured from the most recent working iteration has been instrumental in refining our aerodynamic flight model, providing the team with a level of telemetry precision previously unavailable.</p>

          <h4>Technical Design</h4>
          <p>Designed a custom rig featuring a <strong>linear rail interface</strong> to isolate thrust vectors using a load cell, a <strong>U-shaped mount</strong> with two load cells to measure torque, and a <strong>universal motor mount</strong> to swap propulsion units quickly.

          <h4>Objective: Model Generalizability</h4>
          <p>The primary engineering objective was to validate that the proprietary <strong>Vayu Sense</strong> camera and AI foundation model could generalize to novel robotic platforms without requiring a complete retraining of the neural networks.</p>
          <p>The goal was to prove that by simply updating the <strong>camera intrinsics and extrinsics</strong> (calibration data), the perception stack could instantly adapt to different robot kinematics—specifically testing on a Unitree Go2 Quadruped and a Humanoid platform.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quadrant">
          <h4>The Engineering Challenge</h4>
          <p>We needed to bridge two distinct software architectures:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vayu Ecosystem:</strong> A high-fidelity perception and path planning stack providing semantic understanding and depth.</li>
            <li><strong>Unitree Ecosystem:</strong> A closed-source low-level control API for motor actuation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>My role was to architect the hardware and software "bridge" to allow the Vayu brain to drive the Unitree body.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="full-width-section">
        <h4>Integration Methodology</h4>
        <div class="timeline">
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Phase 1: Low-Level Control & Hardware</b>
            <span>I began by reverse-engineering the Unitree API to understand how to programmatically command velocity and yaw vectors. Simultaneously, I designed and fabricated a custom mounting solution to affix the Vayu Sense compute unit and camera array to the robot's back, solving for vibration isolation and ensuring the camera extrinsics remained static relative to the robot frame.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Phase 2: The Software Bridge (Perception to Action)</b>
            <span>To close the loop, I developed a ROS-based interface linking the two APIs. The Vayu model processed visual data to generate a viable path, which I fed into a <strong>Pure Pursuit</strong> algorithm I implemented. This algorithm calculated the necessary curvature and velocity commands, which were then translated into Unitree-specific packets to drive the robot along the path.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="iteration">
            <b>Phase 3: Calibration vs. Retraining</b>
            <span>The critical success of this project was the validation of the calibration pipeline. Instead of retraining the model (which is computationally expensive), we successfully demonstrated that by mathematically defining the new sensor position (extrinsics) and lens properties (intrinsics), the model successfully "understood" its new height and perspective, allowing for accurate obstacle avoidance immediately.</span>

          <li><strong>Humanoid Scalability:</strong> Established the initial calibration and mounting framework for the Humanoid robot, applying the same intrinsic/extrinsic transformation logic used on the quadruped.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Validated that this vision-based approach could match the navigation fidelity of LiDAR-based systems at a <strong>50x lower hardware cost</strong>.</li>

            <span>Standard roller intakes failed to handle the variance in game object as it traveled from 0 degrees to around 45 degrees. I designed a novel hybrid architecture:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Stage 1 (Acquisition):</strong> Utilizes high-compliance elastomer wheels to deform the object, maximizing friction and acquisition speed even at oblique angles.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 2 (Indexing):</strong> Transitions to rigid hook geometry to mechanically lock the object in place, ensuring deterministic positioning for the scoring mechanism.</li>
              </ul>
              This hybrid approach decoupled the "speed" requirement from the "precision" requirement, solving the jamming issues inherent in single-stage designs.

            <span>To score on the vertical goals from any chassis orientation, I engineered a 2-bar linkage arm mounted that turns the goal to our desired angle. The end-effector utilizes a friction-based grabber with a passive over-center locking mechanism, allowing the robot to manipulate heavy mobile goals without continuous pneumatics power consumption and makes it extremely hard to steal from our robot.</span>

These spring-loaded, non-driven wheels maintain constant ground contact to measure true displacement, decoupling wheel slip from the robot's localization data.</span>
